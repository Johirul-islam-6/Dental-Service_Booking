                    <p className='px-5 md:px-20 py-5'>DentaQuest Partnership for Oral Health Advancement’s Safety Net Solutions and the National Maternal and Child Oral Health Resource Center have created this revised edition, in collaboration with a team of experts. The original manual was produced by the Ohio Department of Health’s Bureau of Oral Health Services in collaboration with the Association of State and Territorial Dental Directors and Indian Health Services. We gratefully acknowledge the expertise and effort of all collaborators over the span of the manual's lifetime.
                        Safety Net Dental Clinic Manual: Second Edition is a manual designed for you—no matter whether you’re an experienced clinic director, a new administrator, or somewhere in between. We know how challenging running a safety net dental clinic is, and that’s where the manual comes in—to help you with just about everything related to clinic development and operations.</p>
                    <p className='px-5 md:px-20 py-5'>Floor Space
                        The following recommendations for clinic floor space for some of the most common clinic configurations come from the Indian Health Service (IHS). However, all plans should always keep Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) regulations in mind.

                        To determine the total square footage for the dental clinic, the clinic floor space should be multiplied by a conversion factor of 1.3 to allow for wall and hallway space.
                        Space is also needed for staff lockers, staff toilets, and an employee lounge, but these are not listed in the following table, as they may be located in the general facility space if the dental clinic is co-located with a medical clinic or in a school. If the clinic is a stand-alone dental clinic, a staff lounge of at least 120 square feet will be needed. Additional space may be needed, depending on the number of staff at the facility.
                        Lockers for staff items such as coats, hats, and purses are needed and can be placed in the staff lounge or a separate room. The size of the staff lounge and the placement of lockers is a local decision.
                        There should be a designated restroom for clinic staff. Clinics with a staff of six or fewer members can save funds by using a unisex staff restroom. Restrooms require approximately 50 square feet.</p>
